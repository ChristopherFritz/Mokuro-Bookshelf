# Mokuro Bookshelf

Web page for tracking progress in reading manga via Mokuro.

All Mokuro HTML files that have been opened in the browser appear on the page.

Items on page 1 show under "Future".  Items on the final page show under "Finished".  All other items show under "Reading".

Remaining page count and percentage progress increment in real-time while advancing pages in a Mokuro HTML file.

## Dependencies

Relies on Mokuro HTML files generating using my [Mokuro fork](https://github.com/ChristopherFritz/mokuro), which adds extra information (page count and path to cover image) to the local storage.
