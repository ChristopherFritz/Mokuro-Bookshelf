# Mokuro Bookshelf

Web page for tracking progress in reading manga via Mokuro.

All Mokuro HTML files that have been opened appear on the page.

Currently, items on page 1 show under "Future", and items on any other page show under "Reading".

Remaining page count and percentage progress increment in real-time while advancing pages in a Mokuro HTML file.

## Dependencies

Relies generating Mokuro HTML files using my [Mokuro fork](https://github.com/ChristopherFritz/mokuro), which adds extra information (page count and path to cover image) to the local storage.
